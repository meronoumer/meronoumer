# 👋 Hi, I'm Meron Oumer

I'm a college student passionate about using computer science, data, and machine learning to 
solve real-world problems—especially in healthcare, education, and equity. I'm currently pursuing a 
Computer Science and Statistical Data Sciences degree while conducting research, building ML projects, and mentoring others. 
I thrive at the intersection of technology, research, and impact.
